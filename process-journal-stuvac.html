                  Group Meeting #5<br>
                  User Testing @ Manors of Mosman
                </h3>


                  <p>
                      Today, we visited the Manors of Mosman; a retirement village and community in Sydney’s North Shore where we had the opportunity to interview and test 4 different senior citizens with varying skill levels with technology as well as interviewing them on their day to day lifestyle and how they found independent living as well as gaining assistance in their current residence. <br>

                    We gained extremely valuable insight from these users as they provided us with experiences and opinions we would have never have considered previously. Furthermore, they also went in-depth about their current experience with technology - even showing us their current phones and also mentioning how they prefer to use their landlines and really only use their mobile phone (typically a brick phone) in cases of emergency. This led to us making one significant design decision of changing the user interface from a phone into an iPad format as some major issues included that of: 
                    </p>

                    <center>
                      <h4>
                          Being almost afraid on the concept of smartphones<br>
                          Too scared to try <br>
                          Finding the small buttons very difficult to press/read <br>
                          Finding the screen difficult to read <br>
                          
                      </h4>
                    </center>

                  <p>
                      Additionally, whilst we tested the concept on all users, testing the paper prototype proved to be difficult as only 2/4 users were willing. This proved to us that the lack of familiarity truly repulsed the users and a design constraint we would have to overcome. <br>

                      Overall, the user testing session proved to be extremely valuable and we came to several conclusions: </p>

                      <ol>
                        <li>
                            Make a UI for both senior citizens and volunteers to utilise 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The name of the apps are Koala and Joey
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Create two distinct personas - one open to technology, one who is not 
                        </li>
                      </ol>

                      <p>
                          In addition to this, we would also need to complete the visual report as well as an accompanying presentation slidedeck that will showcase the most salient aspects of the report. 
                      </p>

                          Independent Study
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            During Stuvac, I aimed to get my user testing completed in order to not be stressed for the assignment deadline looming. During Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, I worked constantly on iterating Connor and my concept after deciding to have two applications to design UI’s for. <br>

                            From this, I began to iterate upon the UI’s Connor had designed allowing for collaborative stance in our project, furthermore, I was also able to add features that I felt would be necessary as part of the designs. <br>
                            
                            Once I had completed these paper prototypes, I loaded them onto POP prototyping in order to give a more realistic approach when testing with our users. <br>
                            
                            As we had already tested with our senior citizens, it was time for me to test with our younger users who would be identified as the volunteers, I allowed them to go through the app without any guidance, aside from asking them how they would do a certain step and observing whether they would do so correctly. I gained valuable feedback in regards on what should be iterated and what should be changed/removed and even added. The general consensus was the fact that the app was designed somewhat too easily? And this could have been due to the fact that we had been designing for senior citizens up until this point - whereas younger users are definitely more tech savvy and intune with learning new technologies and understanding them. <br>
