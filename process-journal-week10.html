                  Group Meeting #7
                </h3>


                  <p>
                      Wednesday, the 17th of October was the due date for assessment 2, at 11:59pm… <br>
We worked from 12pm onwards and worked towards completing the assignment as quickly as we were able to. Everything was essentially completed, all of the data was collected and information was written cohesively for the report along with the completion of the wireframes - the only thing left was compiling everything together and making the report + appendix. <br>

Doesn’t sound like a lot of work, and we also didn’t think it would take as long as it did, however, pre-planning led to us working past midnight and having to submit the day after, rendering us a 5% penalty. No fault but our own, however it remains very true that worked extremely hard for this second body of work. We were simply unaware of the time constraint (the level of severity) as well as the fact that as we were working, additional constraints or aspects we needed to cover would pop up. <br>

We consistently worked, worked, and worked some more, and I had continued to work until 2am in 313; however, as it was already past the deadline, we decided that it would be better to simply submit in the morning before the presentations were due to start. </p>

                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Since the completion of assessment 2, we decided to have a virtual meeting to talk about the 3 upcoming assessment; 
                            </p>

                            <ol>

                                Interactive prototype

                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                We decided to give ourselves a deadline of Tuesday the 23rd of October for the interactive prototype to give ourselves two additional days to get our process journal completed. 

                                The summary of our conversation included the following:
                                </p>
