                  Independent Study
                </h3>


                  <p>
                      During Monday and Tuesday, I was working on implementing all of the user feedback that was gathered in a way that would allow for the UI to be more usable and for the users to experience less confusion as well as have an overall better experience compared to what they were tested with. <br>

                      There were quite a few changes that were made, being:
                      </p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                            Implementing scrolling feature to allow for more content to be applied onto one page however allowing the user to scroll
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Implementation of a more ‘universal’ language in terms of the app features (i.e. ‘Explore’)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Larger text size
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Greater consistency throughout the application - buttons, headings, nav bars, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Greater transparency, clarity and help given to users during the ride/av stage (i.e. having a map showing exactly where they have to walk, adding a street view feature, etc.)
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>
                          These were just a handful of the iterative changes that were implemented onto the final hi-fi mockup of Joey.<br>

                          In order to ensure this would be completed on time, many hours of sleep were lost, however it was all worth it. :) 
                          
                      </p>

                      <p>

                        During today’s group meeting, we did a bit of everything - working on completing the interactive prototype, as well as working on the companion website and our individual process journals. <br>

                        We gave one another design critique and feedback throughout the day if there was any necessary changes that would be required. We also finished up on adding all of the necessary interactions in order to record a successful narrated video of the applications in progress. <br>

                        We decided that we had quite a bit of time and therefore decided to submit on Thursday (the due date) instead of stressing out and trying to submit today. 

                      </p>

                        Tutorial & Studio
                      </h3>

                      <p>
                          During today’s tutorial and studio, we were finalising our narrative video and compiling all of our files together in order to submit the fourth assessment - interactive prototype. <br>

                          As we had basically completed everything on Wednesday, there wasn’t too much that was left to do aside from the references, editing the narrated video and essentially submitting the assessment! <br>
                          
                          We also worked towards completing the companion website that is due the following day - Friday -  by creating hero shots of both apps.<br>
                          
                          Luckily, due to better time management, we managed to submit this assignment on time, at around 6pm - so therefore a big weight of stress was lifted from our shoulders. <br>
                          
                          Once we had submitted, it was time to crack down on getting the process journal completed!
