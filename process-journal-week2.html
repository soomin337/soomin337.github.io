                <h3>
                  Independent Research
                </h3>


                <p>For my independent research, I decided to delve into the user groups of emergency patients and Sydney’s homeless. The rather large topic were daunting at first and I wasn’t too sure where to begin, that’s where the design methods proved very helpful. 

                    Starting with the emergency patients, I realised I wasn’t even sure what type of emergency situation I was potentially designing for, in this regard, understanding the users of. Therefore I questioned:
                    
                    <center><p> <h3>
                        <b>What would count as an emergency situation?</b>
                        </h3>
                      </p> </center>
                    
                    <p>
                        When noting down all the possible answers, you begin (or I began) to realise that there was so much more, more than I had considered previously. 

                        Despite the fact that solutions shouldn’t come first, I started to jot down some possible focus areas when considering autonomy and emergency situations. 
                        
                        Two main areas were highlighted; autonomous <i>flying ambulances and autonomous delivery drones</i> - both aspects directly related to meeting with the affected users as fast as possible to ensure there was as minimal chance of casualty from ambulance delays - something I had found to be somewhat common. 
                        
                        In terms of the UI consideration, I had considered the aspect in where emergency dispatchers would have the ability to navigate through a highly user centric design that would ensure prioritisation where needed and have the ability to flow with the users’ movements and allow them to proceed with their tasks proactively and minimise mistakes. 
                        
                    </p>

                   <center> <h5>
                      Flying ambulances?
                    </h5> </center>

                    <p>
                        With the flying ambulance concept, I was considering car accidents in rural and remote areas where users are less likely to follow road rules due to less patrolling and fewer vehicles on the road. 

                        Based on research, it was found that there was:
                        
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Lower seat belt usage
                          
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Nearly ⅔ of all fatal road crashes occur on rural and remote roads in QLD
                          </li>

                          <li>
                            Speed was a major factor is causing casualties 
                          </li> 
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, there was <b>12,372</b> patients hospitalised from road traffic crashes in 2016, and when viewing the “Top 10 global causes of deaths, 2016”, vehicle accidents were the only non-health related cause of death - demonstrating the serious nature of car accidents. 
                        
                        For NSW in 2014, there were 690 recorded fatal crashes in regional and remote areas, with road crash fatality rates in rural areas to be over 3 times more likely than in major cities. 
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Only a spoonful of statistical facts and it had become clear to me that:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Car accidents are a major cause of deaths globally</li>
                        <li>Rural and regional areas suffered greater fatality rates over cities </li>
                        </ol>

                       <p> These two observations raise the question of:</p>
                       <ol> <li>How unsafe do drivers choose to be?</li>
                        <li>Are ambulance response and arrival times a factor playing into the survival of a patient? </li></ol>

                        <center><h4>
                            How could autonomous vehicles ensure greater survival rates for patients and behavioural change in drivers/passengers?
                        </h4> </center>

                        <p>
                            The second user area of focus involves Sydney’s homeless. Poverty continues to grow within Sydney city and inner city suburbs as the cost of living continues to increase and people continue to struggle not only living on the streets, however simply not have an address which they can claim as their own. 
                        </p>

                       <center> <h4>
                            But firstly, who are they?
                        </h4> </center>

                        <p>
                            Passerby’s avoid them, the government tries through their actions to help them, but <i>who</i> are Sydney’s homeless? Stats have shown that they are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>

                          </li>
                          <li>

                          </li>

                        </ul>
   
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The poverty line in Sydney include those who earn less than $400 per week, with homeless youths rising 92% between 2006 and 2016. There are government and volunteer initiatives which run 7 nights a week providing food, water, blankets and other amenities for these users, however these vans are typically limited to Sydney city and surrounds; such as Martin Place, Surry Hills and Haymarket. However, there are homeless citizens throughout Sydney, such as Parramatta, and regional suburbs. 

                        One major aspect that I found couldn’t be overlooked was the fact that the users appreciated the aspect of companionship when they were provided with food and resources. Direct human interaction was just as important as the food they were given. Proposing the question:
                    </p>

                    <center> <h4>
                        If there was an autonomous food/supply van for homeless citizens, would they like? Dislike?
                        How would human interaction become affected?
                    </h4> </center>

                    <p>
                        Whilst the idea of autonomous food & supply vans seems like a somewhat logical solution for the future, the fact that human contact and familiarity has the potential to be affected - it could alternatively scare such users away from seeking and accepting help. 
                    </p>

                      Reflection:

                    <p>
                        Currently at the tip  of the iceberg - whilst research is interesting and good insights have been found, I will need to regroup with Connor in order to understand where our problem scope will fall under before conducting more research. 
                        However, I have found that I have countless ideas for user testing methods and generating the necessary data for our autonomous concept - whatever it may become.                         
                    </p>

                <p>
                    For our first group meeting, we had the opportunity to collate all of our research from the past week since the first tutorial and studio. Based on the tasks we had each been assigned to complete, it was quite clear which direction we were now headed towards. 

                    Based on our 4 areas of research, these were our key notes and opinions: 
                  
                    <h5>
                      Public Transport
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Although promising, advancements in autonomous UI and technology are already being implemented in NSW and around the world, therefore we felt there wasn’t sufficient room for greater innovation.
                    </p>

                    <h5>
                      Senior Citizens
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Senior citizens are only growing in numbers and this demographic is often overlooked and neglected. There is a great area for innovation with autonomy in regards to senior citizens, specifically with transport and mobility. This is one area we believe is promising and would like to look further into.  
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                      Rapid Medical Aid
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Flying doctor services exist, however making them autonomous is something that has great potential. This topic would allow use to delve directly into how emergency aid work is provided - however gaining user insight and research would prove to be challenging. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                      Sydney's Homeless
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      Based on the secondary user research that was conducted, found that a big part of homeless food drives was related to companionship. Essentially, autonomous vehicles could have the damaging effects of eliminating human interaction which would greatly affect not only the homeless citizens, however volunteers alike. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From this mini analysis, it was quite clear that we were very much interested in heading towards the senior citizen route. Why? Largely due to the high promise we could see in the topic and having the ability to expand upon the idea. 

                        From this conclusion, we decided we wanted to go straight into the user research, we began to think of specific methods and user research methods we wanted to employ in order to collect useful and valuable data for our problem space with AV’s. Our main areas of focus involved:
                        
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                          Questionnaire; for the quantitative data and to understand our demographic and who we are designing for
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Interviews; interviewing our target demographic to get a personal and more in-depth understanding of the struggles they may face and their day to day lifestyle
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Contextual observation; shadowing and observing unobtrusively 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Testing with existing apps/products
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Competitor analysis of existing travel/public transport apps 
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        By understanding what we needed to find from our user scope, we began noting and thinking of questionnaire queries in order to gather big data, that would help us in understanding our demographic and their general grasp on smart device usage and public transport frequency. 

                        We also felt it would be useful to analyse existing public transport/ride sharing/travel apps in order to understand their UI and see where they have designed with the users in mind. Alongside this, observing senior citizens utilising public transport through shadowing and contextual observation was also another area we were sure we wanted to conduct, as it would allow for solid data in terms of the user interaction between public transport travelling from A to B. 
                        
                        Therefore, the goal for us before class on Thursday is to hopefully have completed the questionnaire (for approval from tutor), to conduct competitor analysis and have basic notes on contextual observation and research.

                  This meetup allowed us to understand what we wished to move forward with - ensuring we were both on the right page and understood the tasks we needed completed before our next meetup.
                  As of current, everything seems to be moving smoothly, which is great, it’s good to see that we are able to work well together.

                <p>
                    Tutorial was led by Katja Forbes who unpacked what the design process essentially is. Was great to hear her direct insight and learnt that although quite obvious, every design process is <b>unique.</b> Something that should be considered a ‘no brainer’, I found myself forgetting. 
                    We also learnt about divergent & convergent thinking models, where divergence allowed for the crazy and wacky ideas to be put to paper and convergent thinking ensured ideas maintained logistics and viability. This idea was coupled with the ‘Double Diamond’ process model ensuring a balance of divergent and convergent thinking throughout the design process.
                </p>

                    Additionally, we had the opportunity to understand who our key stakeholders are within the problem space we had defined, with the stakeholder model of Core, Direct and Indirect stakeholders which led us to understand who we needed to talk with and who we didn’t necessarily need to talk with. 

                    This further allowed us to understand what user research methods we would be employing to gather the data that would actually help us and back up our ideas. 
                    
                    During the studio:
                    Initially we felt confident in what we had done before this week. But then, we weren’t so. 
                    
                    We had the opportunity to talk to Sophie about our ideas and where we were headed, where we failed as designers was coming up with a solution and not fully dissecting the problem space. The main issue with this was:                    
                </p>

                <center><h4>What were we really solving? Was what we were planning on producing (automated public transport for seniors) actually something that had a great need? </h4></center>
                    <p>
                        The answer to that wasn’t no but it wasn’t a definite yes either. We had stepped 5 steps forward instead of taking one step at a time and truly understanding the problem scope. This led us needing to understand what exactly our problem was. We wanted to continue on the path of senior citizens, however to kill our initial idea of public transport for the elderly. We had a few issues initially, as we continued to only be solution focused.

                        We decided to then just write down words, words such as transport, environmental, social, medical, etc. in order to gage what we wanted to focus on and where we could find a viable and interesting problem space we could follow with. Whilst we did this, we still weren’t able to completely detach from public transport!
                        (attach image)
                        
                        We decided to then Google “problems that senior citizens face”, and the results proved to be very helpful and allowed us to think beyond public transport and think beyond our perception of the struggles and burdens that senior citizens currently face. We constructed a digital mind map, that spanned much larger than we had ever considered, with problem areas in PTSD, financial predatory burden, social anxiety and even abandonment. Facing these concepts allowed us to realise the much larger and greater scope of problems in which senior citizens are facing and how we could potentially design for them.

                    <p>
                        Although difficult, this studio allowed us to learn a great deal more about the design process, despite thinking we were well on track. 

                        Our goals for Saturday:                      
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                          Plan to have a Skype session on Saturday discussing our next plan for action and decide where we aim to go from where we have reached
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          My aim is to question senior citizens on what kind of problems they face in their lifestyle
                          My plan is to question whilst I am interacting with customers at my job at Optus
                          
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Try and gain a greater grasp on senior citizens and the problems they face in order to gain a greater understanding on the user data we wish to collect
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>
                      Reflection:
                    </h4>
                </p>
                <p>In complete honesty, we were quite worried, the idea that all the research we had conducted during the first and second week could potentially go down the train definitely affected our train of thought during the studio. However, I continued to remind myself that this is the nature of design and that this is how design works. If we didn’t encounter these issues, we weren’t following the design process because whenever the design process is followed these hiccups along the way are bound to occur. 

                The studio session allowed us to recognise our faults early on and where we have room for improvement. Furthermore, it also allowed us to fully dissect and gain a greater understanding of our problem area and scope that would help us in the long run.
