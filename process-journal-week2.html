                  Independent Research
                </h3>


                <p>For my independent research, I decided to delve into the user groups of emergency patients and Sydney’s homeless. The rather large topic were daunting at first and I wasn’t too sure where to begin, that’s where the design methods proved very helpful. 

                    Starting with the emergency patients, I realised I wasn’t even sure what type of emergency situation I was potentially designing for, in this regard, understanding the users of. Therefore I questioned:
                    
                    <center><p> <h3>
                        <b>What would count as an emergency situation?</b>
                        </h3>
                      </p> </center>
                    
                    <p>
                        When noting down all the possible answers, you begin (or I began) to realise that there was so much more, more than I had considered previously. 

                        Despite the fact that solutions shouldn’t come first, I started to jot down some possible focus areas when considering autonomy and emergency situations. 
                        
                        Two main areas were highlighted; autonomous <i>flying ambulances and autonomous delivery drones</i> - both aspects directly related to meeting with the affected users as fast as possible to ensure there was as minimal chance of casualty from ambulance delays - something I had found to be somewhat common. 
                        
                        In terms of the UI consideration, I had considered the aspect in where emergency dispatchers would have the ability to navigate through a highly user centric design that would ensure prioritisation where needed and have the ability to flow with the users’ movements and allow them to proceed with their tasks proactively and minimise mistakes. 
                        
                    </p>

                   <center> <h5>
                      Flying ambulances?
                    </h5> </center>

                    <p>
                        With the flying ambulance concept, I was considering car accidents in rural and remote areas where users are less likely to follow road rules due to less patrolling and fewer vehicles on the road. 

                        Based on research, it was found that there was:
                        
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Lower seat belt usage
                          
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Nearly ⅔ of all fatal road crashes occur on rural and remote roads in QLD
                          </li>

                          <li>
                            Speed was a major factor is causing casualties 
                          </li> 
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, there was <b>12,372</b> patients hospitalised from road traffic crashes in 2016, and when viewing the “Top 10 global causes of deaths, 2016”, vehicle accidents were the only non-health related cause of death - demonstrating the serious nature of car accidents. 
                        
                        For NSW in 2014, there were 690 recorded fatal crashes in regional and remote areas, with road crash fatality rates in rural areas to be over 3 times more likely than in major cities. 
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Only a spoonful of statistical facts and it had become clear to me that:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Car accidents are a major cause of deaths globally</li>
                        <li>Rural and regional areas suffered greater fatality rates over cities </li>
                        </ol>

                       <p> These two observations raise the question of:</p>
                       <ol> <li>How unsafe do drivers choose to be?</li>
                        <li>Are ambulance response and arrival times a factor playing into the survival of a patient? </li></ol>

                        <center><h4>
                            How could autonomous vehicles ensure greater survival rates for patients and behavioural change in drivers/passengers?
                        </h4> </center>

                        <p>
                            The second user area of focus involves Sydney’s homeless. Poverty continues to grow within Sydney city and inner city suburbs as the cost of living continues to increase and people continue to struggle not only living on the streets, however simply not have an address which they can claim as their own. 
                        </p>

                       <center> <h4>
                            But firstly, who are they?
                        </h4> </center>

                        <p>
                            Passerby’s avoid them, the government tries through their actions to help them, but <i>who</i> are Sydney’s homeless? Stats have shown that they are:

                    <p>
                        For my own independent research that I have committed to undertake before our first official group meeting involves understanding the users and experiences from emergency patients to Sydney’s homeless. Before diving straight into this, I realised that I really needed to unpack each layer to gain a greater grasp of exactly what I would be researching during this very initial stage. 
                        Therefore, in order to unpack my thoughts I noted the aspects in which I wish to explore as seen from the image below. Firstly, for the emergency medical aid for patients, I wanted to understand how the current system in place affected such users. For example, an EpiPen. 
                    </p>

                    <center><p> <h3>
                      <b> What would a user do when they were in an emergency situation and required an EpiPen?</b>
                      </h3>
                    </p> </center>

                    <p>
                        Do they simply call 000? <b>What do they DO</b> and how can we make this process autonomous and enhance not only the user experience, however integrate a easily accessible and usable user interface that will ensure these emergency situations are handled correctly and safely. 
                        Therefore, the problem scope is established. Now to gain a greater understanding of what the user would do in such a situation, a storyboard can be produced - of the current methods and the users emotions and pain points that they would experience. 
                        Secondly, how are Sydney’s homeless citizens provided with food, water and amenities? Through volunteers or through government initiatives? Are there currently existing autonomous food delivery vehicles for such a target demographic? 

                        These were the questions I found asking myself when faced with this particular problem scope? Additionally, who would be the primary, and who would be the secondary users? This aspect is particularly important to consider as we would have to understand who would be interacting and utilising the UI created for the autonomous vehicle.

                        From these initial prospective questions, it has allowed me to understand the kind of user research and data that would be required, and delve deeper into the problem scope - although initial, is still important and necessary. 

                    </p>

                    <h4>
                      Reflection:
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        Whilst looking at the problem from the surface level, it appears to be easily fixed, or easy to provide a solution. However, upon questioning the current systems in place and how autonomous technologies could disrupt and improve the current UX, it has become quite clear that the users must come first and their input to the solution will play the biggest factor. 
                    </p>
