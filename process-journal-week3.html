                  Independent Research
                </h3>


                <p>Since the 2nd week studio, I had the opportunity to conduct informal user research during work, specifically understanding how senior citizens feel towards technology and electronics. 

                    As I am currently employed at Optus, dealing with customer frustrations with technology and servicing is a daily occurence, and therefore I began to contextually observe as well as listen to feelings of worry, concern and frustrations from our senior citizens customer base. These users were typically misunderstood, had trouble dealing with their new phone, had trouble using their existing phone, or just general queries that were often unrelated to Optus. Many of these users felt the need to mention there lack of product knowledge, and some even going beyond to mention things such as :
                    </p>
                    <center><p> <h3>
                        <b>“I know it’s a silly question, but I’m hoping you can help me…”<br>
                            “It fees horrible not knowing how to use technology…”<br>
                            “Can you do it for me?”<br>
                            “You must think I’m a dummy…”
                            </b>
                        </h3>
                      </p> </center>
                    
                    <p>
                        Such phrases are thrown around constantly by our senior citizen customer base, which demonstrates the overall feelings of technology in which they face on the daily. Although this was a very informal user study, it gave me great insight as to how senior citizens feel towards technology and how this is a problem area we could very much look into as it will be recurring, constant and the user group would cover all senior citizens. 
                    </p>

                    </center>
                    <p>
                        Whilst the user research I was able to do at Optus will prove valuable, I am still concerned about which problem scope we will choose as we have limited time to get everything done! I am hoping that during our next group meeting (tomorrow), we will be able to lock down on a problem area that will help us greatly in getting the ball rolling and starting to gather the necessary data for our first assignment.

                    </h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For today’s group meeting we were able to finally find and decide on a problem scope in order to begin conduct user research and study. We talked about what we were really solving, and what we really wanted to solve for our target users, sticking to the user of senior citizens as we felt that there was a great deal of improvement that could be applied to their way of living as well as their social interactions and the pain points in which they consistently experience. 

                    We were asking ourselves - what did we really want to solve for senior citizens? We began to list them as so:                     
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <b>
                    <li>
                        Their way of life in relation to social interaction, health and access to resources
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have a way for them to be more independent whilst still gaining the necessary assistance they felt they required
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To remove the element of isolation and allow them to be more socially interactive 
                    </li>

                  </b>

                </ol>

                <p>These were the problem areas we wanted to solve - and the only ‘solution’ we could think of was autonomous shuttles! However, the concept is extremely been there, done that, therefore, we dug deeper… and then a thought came to my head - <b>volunteers. </b>

                    There are so many people in the community and many of them of volunteered at least once, or consistently volunteer throughout their lifetime. Such volunteers volunteer for events, community service and outreach, church, etc., and more often than not, it is completely independent and people do this for their own goodwill. Therefore, we began to think: 
                    </p>

                    <center><p> <h3>
                        <b> What if there was a streamlined autonomous process for connecting these volunteers with their local elderly citizens/elderly homes to allow for assistance with social activities, day to day living and health. 
                            </b>
                        </h3>
                      </p> </center>

                      <p>
                          Which could be assisted with the use of autonomous vehicles as well. <br>
                          This allowed us to incorporate a new core stakeholder to our user group - <b>showing elderly citizens + volunteers. </b>
                      </p>

                  Tutorial & Studio
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Before the tutorial, Connor and I had conducted a focus group surrounding previous volunteers and their opinions on volunteering in general as well as how they would feel on potentially volunteering to help senior citizens. We had the opportunity to have 7 people in our focus group whereby they all gave their opinions and stories on volunteering and how they would feel about volunteering for senior citizens.

                  Tutorial:
                </h5>
                <p>
                    During the tutorial we were visited by Hendrick Muller, who works as a UX designer at Google. He gave a tutorial on how to create and gather meaningful user data that would be very helpful in the making of a new product or experience. We went through several exercises on gathering user research which was very helpful for the assignment at hand. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>
                        Studio:
                      </h5>

                <p>
                    During the studio, we realised that we needed to step a few backwards yet again… :(
                      Our idea of combining volunteers and senior citizens was already in the direction of a solution, which is what we didn’t want at this stage. During the studio I began question whether senior citizens was the direction that we should be taking… However, based on the research we had already conducted, as well as the time frame, it would prove to be very difficult if we were to completely change our user group. Therefore, we decided to stick to what we had, however to conduct more user research.
                      </p>
                      
                      <p>
                          I decided to search for more problems and decided to:
                      </p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                            Conduct interviews with my grandparents (in Korea) and my dad to gain their insight on the aging population in Asia as well as any other issues that senior citizens in Asia may face. 
                          
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Begin contextually observing senior citizens taking public transport and utilising technology (phones) at Optus.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Map the space of customers who are senior citizens observing how they move about in the space
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Conduct more secondary research on:<br>
                            The problems senior citizens face <br>
                            Why there is more poverty in Asian countries amongst senior citizens as well as the aging population. 
                            
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>
                          This felt like my best course of action in order to gain great insight in different areas of senior citizens as well as expand our problem scope in order to have greater data selection and usage for our upcoming assignments. 
                      </p>

                    </h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although progress has been made, I am quite stressed, however, the fact that I am able to conduct more research into a more interesting area of senior citizens has me more excited than I was previously.

                  Independent Study
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Performed contextual observation of senior citizens catching the 352 Marrickville to Bondi Junction on Friday morning and was able to gain some insight into the interactions and engagement of senior citizens that were catching this bus. One interesting observation involved two older ladies, strangers to each other helping one another out by asking each other questions about the bus trip.<br> 

                    Also did space mapping of senior citizens at Optus (photos weren’t taken as I was doing this exercise discreetly), and found interesting consistencies as well as differences between users. Furthermore, had the chance to talk to some senior citizens on the struggles they face. For example, talked to a customer Mary.S who was here to visit her son, whereby she was having trouble with her prepaid sim card. Nothing was actually wrong, she had just not put in the prepaid voucher into her phone - something that the younger generation don’t tend to have problems with. Additionally, it was evident that not only was it difficult to utilise their smartphones, however if they had difficulty with English, the anxiety and issues only seemed to double for them. <br>
                    
                    Conducted interviews with family members about the issues of senior citizens - the issues they face in Korea and how they feel about poverty and the reasoning behind so. Got some great insight into how culture, money and status plays a role as well as general medical issues as well as mental/physical health can play a part into the lifestyles of senior citizens in Korea. <br>
                    
                    I interviewed my grandparents aged 71 and 76 on their opinions of poverty and also questioned their lifestyle and how they feel as a senior citizen living in South Korea. I also interviewed my dad aged 50 who has always lived in Korea and asked him on his perspective of senior citizens as well as asking questions on the problems my grandma faces as she does not have a partner and is very independent despite having to visit the doctors at least 5 times a month. <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>
                      Why contextual observation and mind mapping?
                  </b><br>
                  I chose to conduct a contextual observation and analyse through mind mapping for senior citizens with technology and public transport as I believed they were the best methods in order to gain legitimate and usable insight into the users for each respective context. 

                  For public transport, I chose to observe rather than inquire to see how senior citizens interacted with public transport vehicles, other passengers as well as the bus or train drivers. Through observations, I was able to see how they acted when they needed help, was able to watch and observe their emotions for the duration of their trip, and to also see whether they faced difficulties as well as pain points. Furthermore, I also had the opportunity to see interesting interactions between senior citizens who were: 
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Friends riding together
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Strangers asking each other for trip assistance solely based on the fact that they would identify themselves as senior citizens
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    I found these particular observations interesting, natural and in the moment. Moments I don’t feel like I could’ve captured with contextually observing our user group. <br>

                    For the technology side, I not only observed, however also spoke to senior citizens on the issues they face with smart devices. More so, these senior citizens were very vocal on their discomfort and I rarely had to question them directly. <br>
                    I had the opportunity to hear from these users directly in the setting of a phone store where they had come with their queries and issues; it proved interesting how they seeked help when first arriving and their feelings on the phones and plans as well as their very vocal pain points and areas where they felt like they were lacking in terms of ‘tech savviness’. 
                    
                    By allowing these elderly customers speak their mind in the context of being surrounded by smart devices, they were able to acknowledge what made them frustrated, sad and confused, as well as having the opportunity to clarify any misunderstandings. <br>
