                  Independent Research
                </h3>


                <p>Since the 2nd week studio, I had the opportunity to conduct informal user research during work, specifically understanding how senior citizens feel towards technology and electronics. 

                    As I am currently employed at Optus, dealing with customer frustrations with technology and servicing is a daily occurence, and therefore I began to contextually observe as well as listen to feelings of worry, concern and frustrations from our senior citizens customer base. These users were typically misunderstood, had trouble dealing with their new phone, had trouble using their existing phone, or just general queries that were often unrelated to Optus. Many of these users felt the need to mention there lack of product knowledge, and some even going beyond to mention things such as :
                    </p>
                    <center><p> <h3>
                        <b>“I know it’s a silly question, but I’m hoping you can help me…”<br>
                            “It fees horrible not knowing how to use technology…”<br>
                            “Can you do it for me?”<br>
                            “You must think I’m a dummy…”
                            </b>
                        </h3>
                      </p> </center>
                    
                    <p>
                        Such phrases are thrown around constantly by our senior citizen customer base, which demonstrates the overall feelings of technology in which they face on the daily. Although this was a very informal user study, it gave me great insight as to how senior citizens feel towards technology and how this is a problem area we could very much look into as it will be recurring, constant and the user group would cover all senior citizens. 
                    </p>

                        Whilst the user research I was able to do at Optus will prove valuable, I am still concerned about which problem scope we will choose as we have limited time to get everything done! I am hoping that during our next group meeting (tomorrow), we will be able to lock down on a problem area that will help us greatly in getting the ball rolling and starting to gather the necessary data for our first assignment.

                    For today’s group meeting we were able to finally find and decide on a problem scope in order to begin conduct user research and study. We talked about what we were really solving, and what we really wanted to solve for our target users, sticking to the user of senior citizens as we felt that there was a great deal of improvement that could be applied to their way of living as well as their social interactions and the pain points in which they consistently experience. 

                    We were asking ourselves - what did we really want to solve for senior citizens? We began to list them as so:                     
                </p>

                <ol>

                        To remove the element of isolation and allow them to be more socially interactive

                  This meetup allowed us to understand what we wished to move forward with - ensuring we were both on the right page and understood the tasks we needed completed before our next meetup.
                  As of current, everything seems to be moving smoothly, which is great, it’s good to see that we are able to work well together.

                  Tutorial & Studio
                </h3>

                <p><i>During the tutorial:</i></p>
                <p>
                    Tutorial was led by Katja Forbes who unpacked what the design process essentially is. Was great to hear her direct insight and learnt that although quite obvious, every design process is <b>unique.</b> Something that should be considered a ‘no brainer’, I found myself forgetting. 
                    We also learnt about divergent & convergent thinking models, where divergence allowed for the crazy and wacky ideas to be put to paper and convergent thinking ensured ideas maintained logistics and viability. This idea was coupled with the ‘Double Diamond’ process model ensuring a balance of divergent and convergent thinking throughout the design process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, we had the opportunity to understand who our key stakeholders are within the problem space we had defined, with the stakeholder model of Core, Direct and Indirect stakeholders which led us to understand who we needed to talk with and who we didn’t necessarily need to talk with. 

                    This further allowed us to understand what user research methods we would be employing to gather the data that would actually help us and back up our ideas. 
                    
                    During the studio:
                    Initially we felt confident in what we had done before this week. But then, we weren’t so. 
                    
                    We had the opportunity to talk to Sophie about our ideas and where we were headed, where we failed as designers was coming up with a solution and not fully dissecting the problem space. The main issue with this was:                    
                </p>

                <center><h4>What were we really solving? Was what we were planning on producing (automated public transport for seniors) actually something that had a great need? </h4></center>
                    <p>
                        The answer to that wasn’t no but it wasn’t a definite yes either. We had stepped 5 steps forward instead of taking one step at a time and truly understanding the problem scope. This led us needing to understand what exactly our problem was. We wanted to continue on the path of senior citizens, however to kill our initial idea of public transport for the elderly. We had a few issues initially, as we continued to only be solution focused. 
                        (attach image)
                        
                        We decided to then just write down words, words such as transport, environmental, social, medical, etc. in order to gage what we wanted to focus on and where we could find a viable and interesting problem space we could follow with. Whilst we did this, we still weren’t able to completely detach from public transport!
                        (attach image)
                        
                        We decided to then Google “problems that senior citizens face”, and the results proved to be very helpful and allowed us to think beyond public transport and think beyond our perception of the struggles and burdens that senior citizens currently face. We constructed a digital mind map, that spanned much larger than we had ever considered, with problem areas in PTSD, financial predatory burden, social anxiety and even abandonment. Facing these concepts allowed us to realise the much larger and greater scope of problems in which senior citizens are facing and how we could potentially design for them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although difficult, this studio allowed us to learn a great deal more about the design process, despite thinking we were well on track. 

                        Our goals for Saturday:

                      <li>
                          Plan to have a Skype session on Saturday discussing our next plan for action and decide where we aim to go from where we have reached
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          My aim is to question senior citizens on what kind of problems they face in their lifestyle
                          My plan is to question whilst I am interacting with customers at my job at Optus
                          
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Try and gain a greater grasp on senior citizens and the problems they face in order to gain a greater understanding on the user data we wish to collect
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>
                      Reflection:
                    </h4>
                </p>
                <p>In complete honesty, we were quite worried, the idea that all the research we had conducted during the first and second week could potentially go down the train definitely affected our train of thought during the studio. However, I continued to remind myself that this is the nature of design and that this is how design works. If we didn’t encounter these issues, we weren’t following the design process because whenever the design process is followed these hiccups along the way are bound to occur. 

                The studio session allowed us to recognise our faults early on and where we have room for improvement. Furthermore, it also allowed us to fully dissect and gain a greater understanding of our problem area and scope that would help us in the long run.
