                  Completing the Assignment

                <p>
                    Due to an assignment on the 19th of August, I was really only able to fully start the visual report on Monday the 20th, and whilst I had all of the data, I had to analyse, visualise and put everything altogether. <br>

                    During these 3 days, I was stressed however was able to get everything done, even 6 hours before the due date. 
                    </p>
                    <h3> Monday, 20th of August </h3>
                    <p>
                        Was at university for class from 10am to 6pm for my 3200 class, and began working on the assignment from 6pm onwards until 12am. <br>

                        This night I spent working on transcribing the interviews and analysing such data through affinity diagramming and gaining great insight into the main issues in which senior citizens face in the context of Korea, furthermore, I was also able to identify and link back to the problem area we had been looking into which was isolation in which senior citizens face as they age as the biggest issue. The main areas that I was able to conclude were major points of concern for senior citizens were their social lives, gaining assistance for daily chores and getting around, and their mental and physical health. It was quite clear that mental health was an area that I had not considered, however one that is quite severe in the fact that senior citizens lack an outlet for them to feel happier and not as burdened by their age and presence. <br>
                        
                        Once completing this affinity diagram, I began designing my visual report and decided to finish everything for the next day.

                    <p>
                        I started my day at 7am at Wilkinson, and left at university at 6pm the following day once I had completed my assignment to my satisfaction. <br>

                        This day was mostly spent simply finishing the assignment and outlining the my analysis and collating all of my research methods into a digitised format as well as creating all of the written content. Whilst I had spent the night at university, I was able to complete the report to my liking and satisfaction, and was able to incorporate all of the content in which I felt was necessary.
