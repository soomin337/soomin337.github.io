                </h3>


                <p>Today during our group meeting, we came together with the concepts that we had been developing over the past week. Despite the feasibility, or the craziness of the concepts, we noted them all in order to consider every possible idea. We wanted to explore all the concepts in order to come to a concept that has been founded on research and iteration. <br>

                    We talked over our concepts, before jumping into distributing them into a spreadsheet divided with concept, pros and cons, and AV incorporation. This way, we would have the ability to see both of our concepts laid out with the necessary aspects. <br>

                    Connor had visualised his concepts, and I plan to visualise my top 3 concepts for tomorrow’s studio. Additionally, we also plan to conduct secondary research with senior citizens and UI utilisation, as it would be good to start wireframing from tomorrow and hopefully start testing soon as well. <br>
                  </p>

                  Tutorial:
                </h5>
                <p>
                    During the tutorial, we learnt how to use prototyping and visual tools to aid in our UI testing. Tools such as POP and Sketch were utilised as examples and they proved to be interesting and tools that I definitely see myself using for lofi user testing; especially POP. <br>
                    
                    The remainder of the tutorial was on Sketch, an app I already have experience in, therefore this tutorial didn’t really teach me anything new that I wasn’t aware of. <br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        Studio:
                      </h5>

                <p>
                    During the studio, I began starting on iterating on the first batch of screens for the concepts that I wished to pursue in regards to senior citizens. I initially had three concepts which I had visualised with the use of user journey maps, and they were;
                      </p>
                     <ol>
                       <li>
                          Autonomous Pods w/ the persona of <i>Comfort Christina</i>
                       </li>
                       <li>
                          Grocery Delivery Drone w/ the persona of <i>Analog Allan</i>
                       </li>
                       <li>
                          Public Transport for Senior Citizens w/ the persona of <i>Naive Nelly</i> 
                       </li>
                     </ol>

                      <p>
                          Once analysing these concepts, I concluded that I wanted to focus on the first two concepts as I felt that they were the most interesting in regards to not only how the design of the UI would be, however how it would relate directly to the user needs found from the user research. <br>

                          I firstly started sketching the screens for the Grocery Delivery Drone, although it is not 100% complete in regards to the level of fidelity and the number of screens, the general narrative is evident and this was split over 24 screens.<br>
                          
                          Whilst I was creating these screens, I was able to link directly back to the user needs based on first hand as well as secondary research. The secondary research proved helpful when considering the affordances that had to be included in the screens for our users. Furthermore, I was able to realise just how closely we have to link our intentions with the users and how crucial testing will be for this task in particular. Assumptions must be avoided at all costs regarding how senior citizens utilise smart devices, as this could prove to be a critical mistake if not tested appropriately. <br>
                          </p>
