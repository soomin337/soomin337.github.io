                  Group Meeting #6
                </h3>


                  <p>
                      During todayâ€™s group meeting we were able to come together with our paper prototypes as well as analysing the user research from the testing which we had collected. This involved finishing off the transcription. <br>

                      From transcribing the interviews, began forming affinity diagrams that would allow us to collate our data in a meaningful and accessible way in order to apply the appropriate iterations upon our concepts and ideas. <br>
                      
                      We realised many areas where we needed improvement as well as adjustments based on both the feedback as well as the contextual observations we had made during the user testing - this was particularly necessary for our senior citizen users as they were the core stakeholders and the ones where our design would affect them the most. <br>
                      
                      Furthermore, based on the user data gathered, we also began to start the digital wireframing process through apps like Sketch and Figma, that we would also have the opportunity to test again should we need it. <br>
                      
                      Overall, this group meeting comprised mainly of working towards the completion of the assignment and understanding everything else that we would need to do in order to finish the assignment on time. 
                      </p>

                          Tutorial & Studio
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            During the tutorial, we went through the process for usability testing when utilising all resources that are available to us. Beginning with lo-fi prototyping as well as prototyping through the use of Marvel POP and going through all the motions of user testing. Furthermore, this is something that we had been doing throughout the entire design process for this assignment which further demonstrates how we have been conducting the user research correctly and accurately for this task. <br>

                            During the studio, we simply worked on collating everything necessary for the assignment in time for the submission time - this involved taking photographs of our prototypes, analysing the user data as well as completing our digital wireframes and making the necessary design decisions for the assignment.
